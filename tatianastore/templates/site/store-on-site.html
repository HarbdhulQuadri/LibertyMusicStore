                    <h3>Getting Bitcoins</h3>
                    <p>
                        First you need to get some Bitcoins by buying them. The following two sites are recommended:

                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>U.S: <a target="_blank" href="https://coinbase.com/">CoinBase</a></li>
                        <li>Other countries: <a target="_blank" href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=1af">LocalBitcoins</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Initially you need to buy Bitcoins for a moderate amount. Thi  might be too much for a single song purchase. The usual minimum purchase amount is in
                        range of 20 USD. However, you can later spend Bitcoins on other digital services, or turn them back to cash, as Bitcoins are universal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin exchange rate varies daily. You can check the current market exchange
                        rate on a site like <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitstamp/USD">Bitcoinity</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Making the payment</h3>

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin payment is made by sending Bitcoins from your Bitcoin wallet to the unique <i>Bitcoin address</i> given on the purchase.
                        It takes 15 - 60 seconds for the network to confirm your Bitcoin payment. After this you can download your purchases
                        immediately.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Desktop web browser</strong>: Copy-paste <strong>Bitcoin address</strong> and <strong>Bitcoin amount</strong> into your Bitcoin wallet
                        and send the payment from there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Mobile application wallet</strong>: Scan the presented QR code with your Bitcoin wallet app barcode scanner.
                    </p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img class="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" style="max-height: 300px; margin: 0 auto" src="{% static 'img/payment_example.png' %}" alt="Payment example">
                    </div>

                    <ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Receiving Bitcoin payments</h2>

                    <p>
                        You don't need anything Bitcoin-related to get started on Liberty Music Store. If you do not have
                        a Bitcoin wallet your Bitcoins are held on Libery Music Store until you get one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To receive Bitcoins you need a Bitcoin wallet. You can get one by signing up Bitcoin services. Examples:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>U.S: <a target="_blank" href="https://coinbase.com/">CoinBase</a></li>
                        <li>Other countries: <a target="_blank" href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=1af">LocalBitcoins</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Setting up your Bitcoin wallet details</h3>

                    <p>
                        Log in to the your Liberty Store Management. Copy-paste <strong>Receiving Bitcoin address</strong> from
                        your Bitcoin wallet and save it in your store settings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Liberty Music Store credits Bitcoin purchases daily. You can check the purchase and Bitcoin credit status in <i>Download transaction</i> section of the store management.
                    </p>
