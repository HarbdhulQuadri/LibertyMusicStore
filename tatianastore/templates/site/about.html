                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>
                    Liberty Music Store is my weekend hacking project. It started as a proof-of-concept to show
                    how well Bitcoin adapts to online digital content sales. I wanted to do something in Bitcoin space,
                    which is driven mostly by my curiosity towards the upcoming virtual currency revolution. On my travels
                    I met some interesting artists with mindbogging ideas and here we are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The product is 100% working, though some more work is needed to make it open for the great masses.
                    Thus I'll keeping the registration private until there are sales at least with 3-4 different artists
                    who have given feedback about the service usability.
                    I am especially little proud all the work that went to make Bitcoin payment process as easy as possible.
