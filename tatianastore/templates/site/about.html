        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Liberty Music Store is my weekend hacking project. It started as a proof-of-concept to show
            how well Bitcoin adapts to online digital content sales. I wanted to do something in Bitcoin space,
            which is driven mostly by my curiosity towards the upcoming virtual currency revolution. On my travels
            I met some interesting artists with mindbogging ideas and here we are.
        </p>

        <p>
            The product is 100% working, though some more work is needed to make it open for the great masses.
            Thus I'll keeping the registration private until there are sales at least with 3-4 different artists
            who have given feedback about the service usability.
            I am especially little proud all the work that went to make Bitcoin payment process as easy as possible.
