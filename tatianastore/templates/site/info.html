                    <h2>About <strong>Liberty Music Store</strong></h2>

                    <p>
                        Liberty Music Store is a service where musicians can open their own record store to sell music and receive Bitcoin as the payment.
                        The store can be placed on any web page and unlike other digital music stores out there, the artist has full control over the store.
                        The Bitcoin payment makes the store very easy to use having no need for the upfront signing up. Liberty Music Store
                        is non-profit, 100% transparent and open source.
                    </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How can I add Liberty Music Store on my site?</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the sign up you get a code you can put on your website. For Facebook page you need to be the page manager
                        in order to add the store there.

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How much fee the Liberty Music Store takes from the sales?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently the artist can keep 100% of the purchase price. I am not doing this for money.
                        However if the thing catches fire, I'll set 15% fee to cover the cost of running the service.

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>Why Bitcoin is good for selling music?</h2>
                    <p>
                        People can purchase Bitcoins through various means (credit card, cash, ATM.)
                        <a href="https://localbitcoins.com">Bitcoins can be purchased in any country, even in countries
                        where PayPal, iTunes et. al. don't work</a>.
                        Purchased Bitcoins can be then used to buy all kinds of stuff. Bitcoin transactions are very cheap
                        and scale globally - they fit quite well for doing
                        small payments for the online content. After people obtain their first Bitcoins and Bitcoin wallet, the
                        purchase process is much sleeker and safer than with credit cards. With Bitcoin, you are in control
                        of your money, no one can take it away. As long as Bitcoins stay within Bitcoin the economy,
                        no hidden fees incur. If you cash out Bitcoins back to fiat currency (USD, EUR, GBP) you may need
                        to pay some fee, usually few percents, for the exchange process.
                    </p>
